## The Main Goal 

Focus on a machine learning analysis in Natural Language Processing - build a chatbot

## Project Description

## Project Goals and Requirements 

### Natural Language Processing
* Design and build an NLP prototype. 
* Integrate a machine learning algorithm in an NLP framework (e.g. a chatbot or sentiment analyzer)  
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate your working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Chatbot - topic choice - Why?

Why did I choose the topic of NLP for building a chatbot?
I am currently in a role as supervisor collections but my aspiration is to go into the Product Management direction.
with the Product Management mindset in sight I wanted to investigate the possibilities of building a product in the form of a chatbot, which can serve the purpose of acting as a first interface with the customers by providing simple answers to most frequently asked questions.
As I work in Collections the chatbot is a Finance related one.

# Necessary Deliverables

* **Project repository** <br>

repository includes:
   - A **.gitignore**  file that blocks any images and datafiles, 
   - A **README file** to guide the reader through the project and files and also have a functional file structure. The README file should clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to. 
   - **Python files** and **Jupyter notebooks**<br>
