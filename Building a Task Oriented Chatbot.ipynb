    "3.\tChatbot starts the conversation with Hi (Name inputted), I am your Financial Assistant, how can I be of support today?\n",
    "4.\tUser asks how to pay invoice (wordnet to be used for synonyms of invoice and pay and other similar words). Chatbot retrieves information from the dummy database and retrieves available payment options. Chatbot asks which of the payment methods is wanted by the customer.\n",
    "5.\tUser types one of the payment methods – here we need to use potential spelling errors to still be able to understand the intent\n",
    "6.\tUser asks where can the open invoice be found, in order to be paid? Chatbot asks invoice number, based on invoice number directs to the correct page (create a format of invoice that is accepted). If invoice number is wrong, display a message to prompt for correct invoice number to be mentioned\n",
    "7.\tUsers asks for a copy of the invoice. Same steps as point 6, once invoice number mentioned retrieve a pdf of the invoice or send the link to where the invoice can be found\n",
    "8.\tUsers says my invoice is wrong, I need changes made before I can pay (from wordnet get all the combinations of wrong/not correct/incorrect that could be said about invoice being wrong). Chatbot answers I am sorry you consider your invoice to be incorrect. Can you let me know which of these areas is incorrect (show a dropdown menu with Wrong amount/Wrong Billing Details/Wrong Due Date). Then depending on the choice give an answer with a template that needs to be filled in so that the request can be processed \n",
    "9.\tUser asks how they can change their payment method. Chatbot brings the available payment methods from the dummy database and asks for which payment method is wanted. Based on the choice the instructions are displayed\n",
    "10.\tUser asks how to change the billing details. Chatbot sends link to place where details can be changed\n",
    "11.\tAfter each question ask Was the answer helpful? If yes chatbot asks \"Is there additional topics you need help with?\"  if yes continue with the loop. If no chatbot says May I recommend our recommended payment method Automated payment? You can find more details about the program here. Would you like me to show you how to set it up? If user inputs Yes, Chatbot answers Here is how you can set it up. If user inputs No, then chatbot replies with Thank you for reaching out to us, have a great day!\n",
